#The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#       1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
#The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#       (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
#Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 | 385 = 2640.
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# (1 + 2 + ... + n)^2 = n^2 * (n+1)^2 * 1/4
# 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2 = n * (n+1) * (2n+1) * 1/6

n = 100
print n^2*(n+1)^2*1/4-n*(n+1)*(2n+1)*1/6
