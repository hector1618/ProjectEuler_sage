#Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
#    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
#By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

s = 0 # For total sum
i = 0 # For indexing
f = fibonacci(0)
while f < 4000000:
    if f%2 == 0:
        s+=f
    i+=1
    f=fibonacci(i)
